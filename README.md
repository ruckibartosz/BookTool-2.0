## About The Project
BookTool is a tool designed to help manage apartments, rooms, and customer lists. With this app, users can view a list of current reservations and their status, as well as check the reservation history.

The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can easily input and manage their apartment and room listings, and pricing information. The app also includes a customer database, where users can keep track of contact information and reservation details.

One of the key features of the app is the ability to manage reservations. Users can view a list of current reservations and their status, including whether the reservation is confirmed, canceled, or pending. The app also includes a calendar view, where users can see the reservations for a specific day or week.

The app also allows users to view reservation history. Users can see a list of past reservations, including the reservation details, customer information, and payment information. This feature is particularly useful for tracking repeat customers and analyzing booking trends.
